**Market Simulation**:
Run `python3 simulation.py` or `python simulation.py` depending on which version of Python you have installed. You can experiment with different combinations of agents to see different kinds of interactions by changing the implementation class of the Player interface.

**Notes**:
1. To get an overview of the workflow of the system, take a look at manager.py and player.py
2. We have provided a set of predefined actions, see transaction.py, transformation.py, and mine.py
3. To see how the market system works in details, please refer to market.py and we also have a demo file, which is titled tests/market_test.py.
4. All code is commented.

**Resource Game**:
Run `python3 resource_game.py` or `python resource_game.py` to play the Resource Game. Experiment with different strategies to attain the best results!
